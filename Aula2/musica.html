            <h3>What a Wonderful World</h3>
            <h4>Louis Armstrong</h4>

        </Div>

        <div>
               <br>I see trees of green, red roses too
               <br> I see them bloom for me and you
               <br> And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
               <p>--------</p>
        </div>
        <div>

               <br>I see skies so blue and clouds of white
               <br>The bright blessed days, the dark sacred night
               <br>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
               <p>------------</p>
        <div>

               <p>The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
               <br>Are also on the faces of people going by
               <br>I see friends shaking hands, saying: How do you do?
               <br>They're really saying: I love you</p>
               <p>--------------</p>
        </div>
        <div>
               
               <br>I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
               <br>They'll learn much more, than I'll never know
               <br>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
               <br>Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world
               <p>-----------------</p>
